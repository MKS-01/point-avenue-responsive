        The Black Bear (Ursus americanus), <br />
        however clumsy in appearance, is active,
        <br />
        vigilant, and persevering; possesses
        <br />
        Line great strength, courage, and address; and
        <br />
        undergoes with little injury the greatest
        <br />
        fatigues and hardships in avoiding the
        <br />
        pursuit of the hunter. Like the Deer, it
        <br />
        changes its haunts with the seasons, and
        <br />
        for the same reason, namely, the desire of
        <br />
        obtaining suitable food, or of retiring to
        <br />
        the more inaccessible parts, where it can
        <br />
        pass the time in security, unobserved by
        <br />
        man, the most dangerous of its enemies.
        <br />
        During the spring months, it searches for
        <br />
        food in the low rich alluvial lands that
